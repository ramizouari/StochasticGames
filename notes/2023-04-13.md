## 1. Dataset Generation
### 1.1 Distribution
- Each generated graph will follow a distribution $\mathcal{G}(n,p(n))$  for some $n\in\mathbb{N}^*$
- The weights will follow the discrete uniform distribution $\mathcal{D}(-1000,1000)$

We will generate two kinds of datasets, depending on the nature of the graph

### 1.2 Dense Datasets
- Let $\mathcal{P}=\{0.1,0.2,0.3,0.5,0.7,0.8,0.9,1\}$
- $\mathcal{N}=\{10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100,110,120,130,140,150,200,250,300,400,500\}$
- For each $(n,p)\in \mathcal{N}\times \mathcal{P},$ we will generate $K=1000$ observations $G^{n,p}_1,\dots,G^{n,p}_{K} \sim \mathcal{G}(n,p)$ 

The total number of examples is:
$$
K\times\lvert \mathcal{N} \rvert \times \lvert \mathcal{P}\rvert=160000
$$
The generation was done on a `haswell64` partition with 24 cores. and it took 02:12:38 hours.

## 2. Dataset Annotation
### 2.2 Dense Datasets

The annotation was done using the `MPGSolver` program with the given two assumptions:
- The graphs will be dense
- The constant will be small

The generation was done on a `romeo` partition with 16 nodes each having 24 cores.
It is estimated that this will take ~12 hours.
