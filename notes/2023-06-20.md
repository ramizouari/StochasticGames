## 1. Problems with Open Spiel Implementation
- Tight coupling between different services (Actor, Learner, Evaluator)
- Outdated code, using TensorFlow V1
- No support for networking
- No support for parametric games
- No support for randomised initial positions
- No support for Reverb Buffer
- Breaking many design patterns

## 2. Redefining Game Mechanics
The game should not have fixed number of moves. Instead, it should end as soon as $(v,p)\in \mathcal{V}\times \mathcal{P}$ is visited twice. This will remove any bias from the fixed number of moves.

## 3. Analysis Data
As the analysis data needs to be appended periodically. We need a file format that is well suited for simple appending. While a CSV is natural choice, it does need some preprocessing for nested data. For that, we have chosen the NdJson. Which is a simple extension of JSON:
$$
\text{<NdJSON>}::=   \text{<JSON>} \text{@} \text{<NdJSON>} \mid \varepsilon
$$
