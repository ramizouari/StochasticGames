## 1. Installing Compression Libraries
This is a prerequisite to install boost iostreams, as we used functions that require decompression.

### 1.1 BZip 2
We installed bzip2 with:
```bash
wget https://sourceware.org/pub/bzip2/bzip2-1.0.8.tar.gz
wget https://sourceware.org/pub/bzip2/bzip2-1.0.8.tar.gz.sig
```

We verified the signature, and then we uncompressed the source code with:
```bash
tar -xvf bzip2-1.0.8.tar.gz
```

We installed the library with:
```bash
cd bzip2-1.0.8
make
make install PREFIX=$HOME
make clean
make -f Makefile-libbz2_so
cp libbz2.so.1.0.8 $HOME/lib
cd $HOME/lib
ln -s libbz2.so.1.0.8 libbz2.so.1.0
ln -s libbz2.so.1.0.8 libbz2.so
```

### 1.2 ZLib

### 1.3 LZMA


## 2. Installing CMake Library

The version of cmake used by the system is 2.8.12.2, which is too low to build the project.
We will install CMake 3.26.1:
```bash
wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.26.1/cmake-3.26.1.tar.gz
```

We verified the signature, and then we uncompressed the source code with:
```bash
tar -xvf cmake-3.26.1.tar.gz
```

Then, we configured the library with:
```bash
cd cmake-3.26.1
./configure --prefix=$HOME
```

Then, we compiled the code with:
```bash
make
```

Before installing, the code, we applied tests using:
```bash
make tests
```

And finally, we installed the library on the user's home directory using:
```bash
make install
```

## 3. Installing Boost
We will install boost 1.81

We configure the library with:
```bash
/bootstrap.sh --prefix=$HOME
```

We then compiler it and install it via:
```bash
./b2 install
```
