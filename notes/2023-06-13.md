## 1. GNN
TensorFlow support an implementation of GNNs. Unfortunately, this is not support with the latest version as Tensoflow GNN still uses an old version of Protobuf.

We had to implement the GNN that supports weights layers manually.

## 2. Preprocessing Layers
Rework these layers.
Input should be in the form $(A,W)$ with:
- $A$ the adjacency matrix
- $W$ the weights matrix
