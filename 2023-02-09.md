- We will use **SciPy** 
- Running time of simplex method on Markov Decision Problems
- on SciPy, the *simplex* method was superseeded by the *highs* method
- How do we generate random graphs?
- Puterman: Transforming Markov Decision Process to Linear Programming
- Yi: Simplex is polynomial with respect to Markov Decision Processes
- A mean pay off game can be transformed to an equivalent form such that the states between min-player and max-player are disjoint
- Heuristic Guided Reinforcement Learning
