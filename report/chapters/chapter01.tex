\section{Formalisation}
To define a Mean Payoff Game, we will start by formalising a weighted di-graph\footnote{Directed Graph}.

\subsection{Di-Graph}
A Weighted Di-Graph $\mathcal{G}$ is a tuple $(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E},\mathcal{W})$ where:

\begin{itemize}
		\item $\mathcal{V}$ is the set of vertices.
		\item $\mathcal{E} \subseteq V\times V$ is the set of edges.
		\item $\mathcal{W}:\mathcal{E}\rightarrow \mathcal{R}$ is the weight function, assigning a weight for every edge, with $\mathcal{R}$ some set representing the weight.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Mean Payoff Game}
Formally, a \textbf{Mean Payoff Graph} is a tuple $(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E},\mathcal{W},\mathcal{P},s,p)$ where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\mathcal{G}=(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E},\mathcal{W})$ is a di-graph.
		\item $s\in \mathcal{V}$ denotes the starting position.
	\item $\mathcal{P}=\{\text{Max},\text{Min}\}$ is the set of players.
	\item $p\in \mathcal{P}$ the starting player
\end{itemize}


A  \textbf{Mean Payoff Game} is a perfect information, zero-sum, turn based game played indefinitively on a Mean Payoff Graph as follow:
\begin{itemize}
\item The game starts at $u_0=s$, with player $p_0=p$ starting.
\item For each $n\in\mathbb{N},$ Player $p_n$ will choose a vertex $u_{n+1}\in \Adj u_n,$ with a payoff $w_n\mathcal{W}(u_n,u_{n+1})$
\item The winner of the game will be determined by the Mean Payoff. There are different winning conditions.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Condition C1}
Player $\text{Max}$ wins \textbf{iff}:
$$
\liminf_{n\in\mathbb{N}^*} \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} w_k \ge 0
$$ 
Otherwise, Player $\text{Min}$ will win

\subsubsection{Condition C2}
Player $\text{Max}$ wins \textbf{iff}:
$$
\liminf_{n\in\mathbb{N}^*} \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} w_k > 0
$$ 
Otherwise, Player $\text{Min}$ will win.
\subsubsection{Condition C3}
Player $\text{Max}$ wins \textbf{if}:
$$
\liminf_{n\in\mathbb{N}^*} \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} w_k > 0
$$ 

Player $\text{Min}$ wins \textbf{if}:
$$
\limsup_{n\in\mathbb{N}^*} \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} w_k < 0
$$ 

Otherwise, it is a draw.

\subsection{Well Foundness}
It is not very clear from the definition that the game is well founded. \newline
In fact, there are choices for which the mean payoff does not converge. That is the sequence $\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} w_k \right)_{n\in\mathbb{N}^*}$ does not converge. \newline One such example is the sequence defined by:
$$
w_n=(-1)^{\lfloor  \log_2 (n+1)\rfloor}
$$
For that sequence, the $(2^r-1)$-step mean payoff is equal to:
\begin{align*}
	\sum_{k=0}^{2^r-2} w_k &= 	\sum_{k=1}^{2^r-1}(-1)^{\lfloor  \log_2 (k)\rfloor} \\
	&= \sum_{i=0}^{r-1}\sum_{j=2^{i}}^{2^{i+1}-1}(-1)^{\lfloor  \log_2 (j)\rfloor} \\
	&=\sum_{i=0}^{r-1}\sum_{j=2^{i}}^{2^{i+1}-1}(-1)^i \\
	&=\sum_{i=0}^{r-1}(2^{i+1}-2^i)(-1^i) \\
	&=\sum_{i=0}^{r-1}(-2)^i \\ 
	&= \frac{1-(-2)^r}{3} \\
	\implies \frac{1}{2^r-1}\sum_{k=0}^{2^r-2} w_k  &= \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1-(-2)^r}{2^r-1} \\
&= \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{2^{-r}-(-1)^r}{1-2^{-r}}
\end{align*}
That sequence has two accumulation points $\pm \frac{1}{3},$ and thus, it does not converge.

On the other hand, the introduction of the supremum and infimum operators will solve the convergence problem, as the resulting sequences will become monotone.

An example of an execution that gives a rise to such payoffs is the following game:  
% Insert Mean Payoff Game
With the following pair of strategies\footnote{Note that the proposed pair of strategies is odd in the sense that it appears that both players cooperated on the construction of non-convergent mean payoffs instead of trying ot win the game.}:
% Insert Strategy.
\subsection{Symmetries}

\subsection{Strategy}
Let $p$ be a player. \newline 
A (deterministic) strategy\footnote{By default, we refer to deterministic strategies. If the strategy is not deterministic, we will explicit it.} is a function $\Pi_p:\mathcal{V}\rightarrow \mathcal{V}$ such that:
$$
\forall v\in\mathcal{V}, \Pi_p(v) \in \Adj v
$$

A probabilistic strategy $\Phi_p:\mathcal{V}\rightarrow \mathscr{P}(V)$ is a random process that assigns for each vertex $v\in\mathcal{V}$ a probability distribution over $\Adj v.$ This constitutes the most general strategy of a player.

\section{Evaluating Strategies}
Suppose we have a pair of potentially probabilitic strategies $(\Phi^{\Max},\Phi^{\Min}).$ The problem is to evaluate the winner without doing an infinite simulation of the game. 
\subsection{Deterministic Strategies}
If both strategies are deterministic. Then the generated sequence of vertices $(s_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ will be completely determined by the recurrence relation:
$$
s_n=\begin{cases}
	s & \text{if } \space n=0 \\
	\Phi^{\Max}(s_{n-1})& \text{if}\ n \ \text{is odd} \\
	\Phi^{\Min} (s_{n-1}) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
This can be represented in the compact form:
$$
\forall n\in\mathbb{N}^*,\quad \left(s_n, p_n
\right) = \left(\Phi^{p_{n-1}}(s_{n-1}), \bar{p}_{n-1}\right) = F(s_{n-1},p_{n-1})
$$

Since $\mathcal{V} \times \mathcal{P}$ is a finite set and $F$ is a function, such sequence will be eventually periodic, that is:
$$
\exists N \in \mathbb{N},\exists T\in\mathbb{N}^*/\quad \forall n\in\mathbb{N}_{\ge N},\quad (s_{n},p_{n})=(s_{n+T},p_{n+T})
$$

We can calculate its eventual period using the turtle hare algorithm. %Reference?

Now, the mean payoff will be equal to the mean of weights that appears on the cycle. \newline
This can be proven as follow.:
% w_n has offset N
\begin{align*}
	S_{aT+b+N}&=\sum_{k=0}^{aT+b+N-1} w_{k} \\
	&= \sum_{k=0}^{N-1}  w_{k}  + \sum_{k=0}^{aT+b-1} w_{k+N} \\
	&= \sum_{k=0}^{N-1}  w_{k}  + a\sum_{r=0}^{T-1} w_{r+N} +  \sum_{r=0}^{b-1} w_{r+N} \\
	\implies \left \lvert S_{n+N}- \lfloor \frac{n}{T}\rfloor \sum_{r=0}^T w_{k+N}  \right\rvert &\le (N+T-1) \max_{(u,v)\mathcal{E}} \lvert \mathcal{W}(u,v) \rvert  \\
	&\le (N+T-1) \lVert \mathcal{W} \rVert_{\infty} \\
\implies \left \lvert \frac{1}{n+N}S_{n+N}-\frac{1}{n+N} \cdot \lfloor \frac{n}{T}\rfloor \sum_{r=0}^{T-1} w_{k+N}  \right\rvert &\le \frac{N+T-1}{n+N}  \lVert \mathcal{W} \rVert_{\infty} \\
\end{align*}
Now it can be proven that:
$$
\lim_{n\rightarrow +\infty } \frac{1}{n+N} \cdot \lfloor \frac{n}{T}\rfloor \sum_{r=0}^T w_{k+N}  = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{r=0}^{T-1}w_{r+N}
$$
With that:
$$
\lim_{n\rightarrow +\infty} \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} w_k=\frac{1}{T}\sum_{r=0}^{T-1}w_{r+N}  \quad \blacksquare
$$
%Insert Graph Loop picture
This calculation leads to the following $\mathcal{O}(\lvert V \rvert)$ algorithm that calculates the mean payoff of deterministic pairs of strategies:

\subsection{Probabilistic Strategies}
Due to the undeterministic nature of probabilistic strategies, it does not make sense to evaluate the mean payoffs, as different executions may lead to different mean payoffs. \newline
%Proof of discrete distribution nature
%My intuition says that it may not a distribution 
Instead, probabilistic strategies gives rise to a discrete distribution of mean payoffs. \newline
Now two closely related, but different evaluations are possible
\begin{itemize}
	\item Expected Mean Payoff
	\item Distribution of winners 
\end{itemize}
Now, with both strategies fixed. A Mean Payoff Game can be considered as a Markov Chain.
