\chapter*{Abstract}
\acrfullpl{mpg} are being extensively investigated with the hopes of finding a general polynomial time solver. While this is a very desired goal, it is ambitious. We will use instead a \acrfull{rl} method using an underlying \acrfull{dl} model based on \acrfullpl{gnn} that tries to approximate solutions of a \acrshort{mpg} instance. The learnable parameters of the model will be updated using a \acrfull{sp} approach that is inspired from Alpha Zero.

To achieve all this, we will implement a \acrshort{mpg} library, generate two \acrshort{mpg} datasets, and then try solve and analyse them.  We will then design our \acrshort{gnn} model with high focus on keeping as much symmetries as possible in the model itself. Finally, we will implement a whole distributed \acrshort{sp} system based on Alpha Zero that will be used for learning purposes, in the hope of getting a model that plays decently.
