## 1. Connecting to HPC
To connect to HPC, I had to create a docker image, and set its crypto-policies to `LEGACY` mode, as the prime number generated by the server during the Diffie-Hellman algorithm is weak, and thus rejected by default.
Also, setting crypto-policies to `LEGACY` on my main machine can cause vulnerabilities.

## 2. Configuring Runtime
### 2.1 Python

### 2.2 GCC Toolchain
The given HPC has GCC 4.8.2
As this version is too low to support C++20. I had to install a newer version.

Now, I do not have root access. so it is not possible to update the system or install the packages with a package manager.

The solution was to compile GCC manually.
GCC had as dependencies GMP, MPFR and MPC. 

#### 2.2.1 GMP
We downloaded the gmp source code by the command:
```bash
wget https://gmplib.org/download/gmp/gmp-6.2.1.tar.xz
wget https://gmplib.org/download/gmp/gmp-6.2.1.tar.xz.sig
```
We uncompressed the source code with:
```bash
tar -xvf gmp-6.2.1.tar.xz
```

We verified its signature, and then configured the library with:
```bash
cd gmp-6.2.1
./configure --prefix=$HOME/bootstrap
```

Then, we compiled the code with:
```bash
make
```

Before installing, the code, we applied tests using:
```bash
make check
```

And finally, we installed the library on the user's home directory using:
```bash
make install
```


#### 2.2.2 MPFR
We downloaded the gmp source code by the command:
```bash
wget https://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/mpfr-4.2.0.tar.xz
wget https://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/mpfr-4.2.0.tar.xz.sig
```
We uncompressed the source code with:
```bash
tar -xvf mpfr-4.2.0.tar.xz
```

We verified its signature, and then configured the library with:
```bash
cd mpfr-4.2.0
./configure --prefix=$HOME/bootstrap --with-gmp=$HOME/bootstrap
```

Then, we compiled the code with:
```bash
make
```

Before installing, the code, we applied tests using:
```bash
make check
```

And finally, we installed the library on the user's home directory using:
```bash
make install
```

#### 2.2.3 MPC
We downloaded the gmp source code by the command:
```bash
wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mpc/mpc-1.3.1.tar.gz
wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mpc/mpc-1.3.1.tar.gz.sig
```
We uncompressed the source code with:
```bash
tar -xvf mpc-1.3.1.tar.gz
```

We verified its signature, and then configured the library with:
```bash
cd mpc-1.3.1
./configure --prefix=$HOME/bootstrap --with-gmp=$HOME/bootstrap --with-mpfr=$HOME/bootstrap
```

Then, we compiled the code with:
```bash
make
```

Before installing, the code, we applied tests using:
```bash
make check
```

And finally, we installed the library on the user's home directory using:
```bash
make install
```

#### 2.2.4 GCC
